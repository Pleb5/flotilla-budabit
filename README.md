# Flotilla

A discord-like nostr client based on the idea of "relays as groups". WIP.

# Deploy

To run your own Flotilla, it's as simple as `npm run build`, then serve the `build` directory.

# Development

Run `npm run dev` to get a dev server, and `npm run check:watch` to watch for typescript errors. When you're ready to commit, run `npm run format && npm run lint` and fix any errors that come up.
