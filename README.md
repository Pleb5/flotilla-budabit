# Flotilla

A discord-like nostr client based on the idea of "relays as groups". WIP.

# Notes

- [ ] If the user isn't following anyone, show warning/fallback on people/notes pages
- [ ] Add person drawer with info and recent notes, where you can follow/mute them. Maybe same stuff as person search
- [ ] Add react/reply to notes
- [ ] Indicate cut-off images, allow user to expand
- [ ] Sort/migrate repository data to keep important events
  - Get rid of stuff from spaces the user isn't currently a member of
